# PART 1

# Arrays are used for storing items sequentially.
# They can include any objects.
# Arrays are mutable object just like strings.
# You can use the [] or slice methods on them!
# The items are called elements, and the number
# where the items are stored, are called indexes.
# Like strings, they have concat, <<, +=, delete methods
# Arrays also have push, pop, shift, unshift methods.
# You can transpose an Array, rotate an array.
# There are also bang methods that don't change the
# memory location of an array!
# Let's look at Part2 in order to dive into the coding!
