# Section 38 Anagrams 📔

## Running 🚀
Run the anagrams.rb file with Ruby interpreter.

## Description 🍭
This is a challenge section where students have to create an anagram program with Ruby 2.6.0+

## Input and Output 🐣
+ When you give a word to method search, it should return all the possible words than can be formed with the letters of the word.

+ For example ✨
search('triangle')  # => ["alerting", "altering", "integral", "relating", "tanglier", "teraglin", "triangle"]
