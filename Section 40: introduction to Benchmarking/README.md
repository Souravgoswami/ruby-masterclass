# Intro
Benchmarking is a major part in programming.
In general, you can test time needed for a algorithm in real world with the benchmark gem.
It ships with Ruby by default. And it's better than `time` command in Linux because the benchmark shows time consumed by a method!

## SystemMonitor
![SystemMonitor](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/ruby-masterclass/blob/master/Section%2040:%20introduction%20to%20Benchmarking/SystemMonitor.png)
You might be thinking what it is. It's actually a resource monitor for GNU/Linux systems that we will be seeing in the class. If you don't have
a system monitor, you can use this. Just run it with ruby interpreter!
